# Unfortunately, not all Tasks were completed
- See the issues that I've opened for details.
- Your code shows good understanding of code in general.
- And you have solved the tasks that you've solved so far pretty well.
- Unfortunately, you seem to have gotten stuck on the Loading and Saving Part.  
- Knowledge that you might need:
   - Seriaization with Json
   - Saving Data using PlayerPrefs
   - Instantiating and Destroying Prefabs (similar to `ResourceViews`)
- Don't get discouraged by this, please.
- My bar for this assignment might have been a bit high.
- A lot of time has passed since this assignment and I've seen great progression recently on you.

## Temporary Grade: Barely Passed (D)

If you'd like to upgrade your grade to a Passed (C), feel free to try implementing the missing features.
In that case, contact me with a time-limit that you'd like to set for yourself to accomplish the missing tasks.
You may ask for help, even Pair-Programming, but I'd greatly appreciate, if you'd type the code yourself.
